- ### Hi, I’m Fasna Sharaf 👋
     I am an all round web developer. I am a tech enthusiastic with good knowledge of front-end techniques.I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also I like working in a team because I was able to learn faster and much more.<br><br>
     I am a beginner in 𝐌𝐄𝐑𝐍 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤.The main project which I made is my 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐰𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 and a 𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐩𝐩 (which is the one I am currently working right now, which will be a CRUD app).<br><br>
     Apart from web development, I love 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 and 𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 different technical events.😇
